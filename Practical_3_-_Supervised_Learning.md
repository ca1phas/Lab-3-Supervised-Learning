# LAB 3 – Supervised Learning

```
Requirements
```

- Jupyter Notebook + Python (sk-learn, pandas, etc.) + (Optional) Keras-Tensorflow
  **Methodology**

1. Select a 6-month date-range within the total duration of the Covid-19 pandemic (since 2020).
2. Load the Malaysian Covid-19 datasets from [1] and [2], performing any conversions which may
   be necessary. These (and following) steps should all be done in a Jupyter notebook, which will be
   part of your submission.
3. Define a set of features and a single target (e.g. hospitalization, ICU utilisation, infection
   count). The features and the target can have an offset date range.
4. Define a training, testing, and validation data set.
5. Create and train at least two supervised learning techniques. Parameters should be chosen well.
6. Observe the performance and training speed.
   _Note : This practical is an open-ended lab. After the demonstration and briefing by the instructor, students
   are expected to plan and conduct proper procedures to achieve the aim and objectives of the experiments._
   **Report**

- Your report should present your design decisions, your results, and analysis of your results.
- You should also justify your design decisions, especially feature/target selection.
- Be sure to state clearly your selected date range and features/target.
- There is no page limit, but be sensible. Aim for 7-8 pages (less is better than more).
- Remember to include the standard lab title page (this doesn’t count towards your 7-8 pages).
  **Submission**
- Your submission comprises of ONE (1) Jupyter notebook and ONE (1) PDF document (Word
  files not accepted).
- Submission deadline is 7 days after your lab finishes (11.55pm one week after your lab).
- Name the documents Lab3*P<X>*<Group Number>.<file extension> where ‘X’ is your
  practical number (P1 or P2) before submission to WBLE. For example,Lab3_P1_G1.pdf.
  **Groups**
- Groups should be formed for every session, containing only students from the same session. 3
  members per group.
  **Selecting Features and Date Range**
- You are free to select any features and date ranges (must be 6 consecutive months). Make sure
  your date ranges are not identical with any other groups in your session (an online spreadsheet
  [3] is provided to help facilitate this). Some date ranges may prove harder than others, so feel
  free to change to another date range if this is the case.

# LAB 3 – Supervised Learning Marking Rubric

```
Graded Components Weightage
```

- Presentation and Formatting (15%)
- Problem and Model Design (25%)
- Results and Analysis (30%)
- Code Quality (30%)

```
Presentation and Formatting Rubrics
0 Unreadable report.
1 Difficult to read, with obvious errors in formatting, grammar etc.
2 Acceptable, with some errors in formatting, grammar etc.
3 Good readability, appropriate use of graphics/tables. Minimal grammatical and formatting errors.
4 Outstanding presentation and formatting, no errors at all.
```

```
Problem and Model Design Rubrics
0 Not included.
1 Design parameters incompletely presented.
2 Design parameters completely presented.
3 Design parameters presented with reasoning/justification.
4 Design parameters presented with complete reasoning/justification.
```

```
Results and Analysis Rubrics
0 Not provided.
1 Incomplete/inaccurate results with minimal analysis.
2 Results report and some brief analysis provided.
3 Results reported in well organised/summarised manner along with clear analysis.
4 Results attractively presented along with convincing analysis/justification.
```

```
Code Quality Rubrics
0 Not submitted.
1 Very poor code (no cells, hard to read etc.) or provided code does not work.
2 Working code.
3 Code is well organised and commented.
4 Code is easy to read because it is very well organised, showing proper planning.
```

```
Tabulation of Marks
Each graded component receives a mark based on the above rubrics. This assigned mark N is then
divided by the maximum mark for the rubric M and multipled by the weightage W. So the sum of
your report marks S will be:-
